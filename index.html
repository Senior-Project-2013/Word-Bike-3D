				<h3>So, what is Word Bike 3D?</h3>
				<h2>Word Bike 3D is a word game...no, a word stringing EXPERIENCE unlike no other. Players are challenged 					to think outside their mortal 2D senses, and instead, to EXPERIENCE a challenging and competitive 					3D word stringing environment.  If this doesn't answer your question, play EXPERIENCE it.
